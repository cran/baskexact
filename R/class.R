#' Class OneStageBasket
#'
#' OneStageBasket is an S4 class. An object of this class contains the most
#' important design features of a single-stage basket trial.
#'
#' @slot k The number of baskets.
#' @slot shape1 First common shape parameter of the beta prior.
#' @slot shape2 Second common shape parameter of the beta prior.
#' @slot p0 A common probability under the null hypothesis.
#'
#' @details
#' This class implements a single-stage basket trial based on the power prior
#' design or the design proposed by Fujikawa et al. In these designs,
#' information is borrowed between baskets by calculating weights that
#' reflect the similarity between the baskets (and optionally the overall
#' heterogeneity). Posterior distributions for each basket are beta
#' distributions where the parameters are found by adding weighted sums
#' of the observed responses and non-responses in each basket to the
#' prior parameters (or in case of Fujikawa's design by calculating
#' weighted sums of the individual posterior distributions).
#'
#' Currently only common prior distributions and a common null
#' hypothesis are supported.

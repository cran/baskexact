#' Class OneStageBasket
#'
#' OneStageBasket is an S4 class. An object of this class contains the most
#' important design features of a single-stage basket trial.
#'
#' @slot k The number of baskets.
#' @slot shape1 First common shape parameter of the beta prior.
#' @slot shape2 Second common shape parameter of the beta prior.
#' @slot theta0 A common probability under the null hypothesis.
#'
#' @details
#' This class implements a single-stage basket trial based on the design
#' proposed by Fujikawa et al. In this design, at first separate posterior
#' distributions are calculated for each basket based on a beta-binomial model.
#' Information is then borrowed between baskets by calculating weights that
#' reflect the similarity between the basket and computing posterior
#' distributions for each basket where the parameters of the beta posterior are
#' calculated as a weighted sum of the individual posterior distributions.
#' The weight between two baskets i and j is found as (1 - JSD(i, j))^epsilon
#' where JSD(i, j) is the Jensen-Shannon divergence between basket i and j.
#' A small value of epsilon results in stronger borrowing also across baskets
#' with heterogenous results. If epsilon is large then information is only
#' borrowed between baskets with similar results. If a weight is smaller than
#' tau it is set to 0, which results in no borrowing. If for a basket
#' the posterior probability that \eqn{\theta} > theta0 is greater than
#' lambda, then the null hypothesis is rejected.
#'
#' Currently only common prior distributions and a common null
#' hypothesis are supported.

\arguments{
\item{design}{An object of class \code{Basket} created by
\code{setupOneStageBasket} or \code{setupTwoStageBasket}.}

\item{...}{Further arguments.}

\item{p1}{Probabilities under the alternative hypothesis. If
\code{length(p1) ==  1}, then this is a common probability for all
baskets. If \code{is.null(p1)} then the type 1 error rate under the
global null hypothesis is computed.}

\item{n}{The sample size per basket.}

\item{lambda}{The posterior probability threshold. See details for more
information.}

\item{weight_fun}{Which function should be used to calculate the pairwise
weights.}

\item{weight_params}{A list of tuning parameters specific to
\code{weight_fun}.}

\item{globalweight_fun}{Which function should be used to calculate the
global weights.}

\item{globalweight_params}{A list of tuning parameters specific to
\code{globalweight_fun}.}

\item{results}{Whether only the family wise error rate (option \code{fwer})
or also the rejection probabilities per group (option \code{group}) should
be returned.}

\item{n1}{The sample size per basket for the interim analysis in case of a
two-stage design.}

\item{interim_fun}{Which type of interim analysis should be conducted
in case of a two-stage design.}

\item{interim_params}{A list of tuning parameters specific to
\code{interim_fun}.}
}
\value{
If \code{results = "fwer"} then the family wise type 1 error rate is
returned as a numeric value. If \code{results = "group"} then a list with
the rejection probabilities per group and the family wise type 1 error rate
is returned. If all p1 > p0 then the family wise type 1 error rate
is calculated under the global null hypothesis. For baskets with p1 =
p0 the rejection probabilities corresponds to the type 1 error rate, for
baskets with p1 > p0 the rejection probabilities corresponds to the
power.
}
\description{
Computes the exact family wise type 1 error rate of a basket trial .
}
\details{
\code{toer} computes the exact family wise type 1 error rate and the
exact rejection probabilities per group. The family wise type 1 error rate
is the probability to reject at least one null hypothesis for a basket with
p1 = p0. If all p1 > p0 then the family wise type 1 error
rate under the global null hypothesis is computed. The rejection
probabilities correspond to the type 1 error rate for baskets with p1 =
p0 and to the power for baskets with p1 > p0.

\title{Plot Weight Functions}
\usage{
plot_weights(design, n, r1, weight_fun, weight_params = list())
}
\arguments{
\item{design}{An object of class \code{Basket} created by
\code{setupOneStageBasket} or \code{setupTwoStageBasket}.}

\item{n}{The sample size per basket.}

\item{r1}{Number of responses in one basket}

\item{weight_fun}{Which function should be used to calculate the pairwise
weights.}

\item{weight_params}{A list of tuning parameters specific to
\code{weight_fun}.}
}
\value{
A plot.
}
\description{
Plot Weight Functions
}
\details{
The design object is only used for the prior parameters,
which affect the weights of some weight functions.
}
\examples{
design <- setupOneStageBasket(k = 3, p0 = 0.2, shape1 = 1, shape2 = 1)
plot_weights(design = design, n = 20, r1 = 10, weight_fun = weights_jsd)
}
